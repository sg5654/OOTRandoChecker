Early version of a logic checker for the SOH version of OOTR.

This version has a button to take steps through the logic. This is temporary for debug purposes.
The finished product will just automatically loop through the entire thing.
There is a very good chance you'll encounter an error (you can check the developer console by pressing f12)
If so, please do send your seed over to me so I can work out the kinks, preferably on Discord.
The current version was designed with all item locations and entrances randomized, having 6 bosses with Greg as wildcard LACS Ganon's Key.
I'm still actively working on Compatibility for other settings.

Current plans for expansion:

- Improved Dungeon logic, especially for MQ. A lot of them are unfinished
- Improved entrance accessibility determination using a Conditional system
    (Think of entering Darunia's Chamber, if you entered from the LW warp you'd need to overcome the obstacles in the way)
- Trick/Glitch requirement explanation
- Trick/Glitch toggles
